### Test data and production experience

The biggest value for the project (apart from financial contribution to the author) is just **using OpenLogreplictor in production environment** with actual real data.
The nature of the project is that it is a parser for database transaction logs.
For legal and privacy reasons, the test cases with test data are not part of the project.
But they are run before each release and are part of the project's test suite.

### How can I help?

Provide **test scripts** (like SQL) or **test data** (like database transaction logs) with a description of what is expected - if the program does not work as you expect it to work.
Such test data can be used for regression testing and will be part of the project.

### Suggesting Enhancements

The target users of the project are companies who would like to use it for production.
If you have a business case and see a justification for spending resources for a new feature, please discuss that with the author.
If you have an idea for just adding work for the author - just because you know how he can spend his time better, please don't bother yourself.
